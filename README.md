# Vulkan graphics programming in Java

**WORK IN PROGRESS: First chapters published**

This [online book](bookcontents/) will introduce the main concepts required to write graphics games or any other applications using [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) in Java.

We will use [LWJGL](http://www.lwjgl.org/) as the Java library which provides the required bindings to use Vulkan and any other required APIs. This book is the result of my self learning language, that I think it may help the community.
