# Vulkan graphics programming in Java

![Build and Publish](https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/vulkanbook/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)

This [online book](bookcontents/) will introduce the main concepts required to write graphics games or any other applications using [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) in Java.

We will use [LWJGL](http://www.lwjgl.org/) as the Java library which provides the required bindings to use Vulkan and any other required APIs. This book is the result of my self learning language, that I think it may help the community.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a new version which tries to use modern Vulkan features, such us:
> - Dynamic rendering
> - BDA
> - Ray tracing
> - New Vulkan functions (1.3)
> - ...
>
> Therefore, Vulkan 1.3 is required. If you want to access previous version, just go the [legacy branch](https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/vulkanbook/tree/legacy).
