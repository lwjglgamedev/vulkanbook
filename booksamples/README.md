# Table of Contents

The book is structured in the following chapters:

- [Chapter 01](chapter-01): Describes the basic scaffolding code to support rendering.
- [Chapter 02](chapter-02): We start with the first Vulkan pieces of code that will create a Vulkan instance.
- [Chapter 03](chapter-03): We continue with the definition of more basic Vulkan concepts such as the physical and Logical devices, surfaces and queues.
- [Chapter 04](chapter-04): The key mechanism to present images to the screen is presented: the Swap chain.
- [Chapter 05](chapter-05): In this chapter we will setup the basic structures for rendering (render information, command buffers and the synchronization mechanisms). 
- [Chapter 06](chapter-06): In this chapter we define the classes required to define the vertices, use the graphics pipeline and create shaders. We will draw our first shape to the screen (a triangle).
- [Chapter 07](chapter-07): In this chapter we go 3D by implementing depth testing and add windows resizing support.
- [Chapter 08](chapter-08): In this chapter we add support for loading complex 3D models using Assimp and textures.
- [Chapter 09](chapter-09): We will automatically generate mipmaps, add support for transparent objects, add a camera to move around the scene and use dynamic uniform objects.
- [Chapter 10](chapter-10): Vulkan Memory Allocator.
- [Chapter 11](chapter-11): Post processing.
- [Chapter 12](chapter-12): Render of GUI elements through ImGui.
- [Chapter 13](chapter-13): Sound with OpenAL. 
- [Chapter 14](chapter-14): Deferred rendering (I).
- [Chapter 15](chapter-15): Deferred rendering (II). 
- [Chapter 16](chapter-16): Cascade shadows.
- [Chapter 17](chapter-17): Animations.
- [Chapter 18](chapter-18): Buffer Device Address (BDA).
- [Chapter 19](chapter-19): Indirect drawing.
- [Chapter 20](chapter-20): Multi-thread.
- [Chapter 21](chapter-21): Ray tracing.
- [Appendix 01](appendix-01): This chapter provides some insights on how to troubleshoot a loss of device error.
- [Appendix 02](appendix-02): This chapter provides a simple 3D game to put everything together
