# Table of Contents

The book is structured in the following chapters:

- [Chapter 00](chapter-00/chapter-00.md): Vulkan introduction and book pre-requisites.
- [Chapter 01](chapter-01/chapter-01.md): Describes the basic scaffolding code to support rendering.
- [Chapter 02](chapter-02/chapter-02.md): We start with the first Vulkan pieces of code that will create a Vulkan instance.
- [Chapter 03](chapter-03/chapter-03.md): We continue with the definition of more basic Vulkan concepts such as the physical and Logical devices, surfaces and queues.
- [Chapter 04](chapter-04/chapter-04.md): The key mechanism to present images to the screen is presented: the Swap chain.
- [Chapter 05](chapter-05/chapter-05.md): In this chapter we will setup the basic structures for rendering (render information, command buffers and the synchronization mechanisms). 
- [Chapter 06](chapter-06/chapter-06.md): In this chapter we define the classes required to define the vertices, use the graphics pipeline and create shaders. We will draw our first shape to the screen (a triangle).
- [Chapter 07](chapter-07/chapter-07.md): In this chapter we go 3D by implementing depth testing and add windows resizing support.
- [Chapter 08](chapter-08/chapter-08.md): In this chapter we add support for loading complex 3D models using Assimp and textures.
- [Chapter 09](chapter-09/chapter-09.md): We will automatically generate mipmaps, add support for transparent objects, add a camera to move around the scene and use dynamic uniform objects.
- [Chapter 10](chapter-10/chapter-10.md): Vulkan Memory Allocator.
- [Chapter 11](chapter-11/chapter-11.md): Post processing.
- [Chapter 12](chapter-12/chapter-12.md): Render of GUI elements through ImGui.
- [Chapter 13](chapter-13/chapter-13.md): Sound with OpenAL. 
- [Chapter 14](chapter-14/chapter-14.md): Deferred rendering (I).
- [Chapter 15](chapter-15/chapter-15.md): Deferred rendering (II). 
- [Chapter 16](chapter-16/chapter-16.md): Cascade shadows.
- [Chapter 17](chapter-17/chapter-17.md): Animations.
- [Chapter 18](chapter-18/chapter-18.md): Buffer Device Address (BDA).
- [Chapter 18](chapter-19/chapter-19.md): Indirect drawing.
- [Chapter 18](chapter-19/chapter-20.md): Multi-thread.
- [Chapter 18](chapter-19/chapter-21.md): Ray tracing.
- [Appendix 01](appendix-01/appendix-01.md): This chapter provides some insights on how to troubleshoot a loss of device error.
- [Appendix 02](appendix-02/appendix-02.md): This chapter provides a simple 3D game to put everything together
